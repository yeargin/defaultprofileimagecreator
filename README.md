# Default Profile Image Creator

![1](docs/1.png) ![2](docs/2.png) ![3](docs/3.png)

This allows you to create a PNG image using a user's initials on a circle, with the color set by a provided string (e.g. a User ID or their full name) to better differentiate between users. It is an improvement on the typical "mystery man" approach.

* Flexible implementation allows you to write to a cache or render inline
* Font color adjusts for readability on a particular background
